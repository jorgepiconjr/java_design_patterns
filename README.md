# Software Design Patterns in JAVA
Repository based on practical implementation of different [Software Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern), such as Factory Method, Composite, template Method, Iterator, among others.

## Why the creation of this repository? 
During my second 2nd semester of my Computer Science career at the [Technical University of Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/) I took the module [Software Technology](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/smt/st/studium/lehrveranstaltungen?subject=508&lang=de&leaf=2&embedding_id=47eddfa7c5a54ed5be49042aff35a31b) which consists of:
> This lecture covers methods for developing complex software systems using a systematic engineering approach. It emphasizes object-orientation, UML modeling, interactive system architecture, and Java programming with design patterns. Additionally, it introduces project management and software quality assurance as a foundation for future projects.

Due to the comprehensive focus on the study of software development and the implementation of deep domain design patterns, I would like to show my knowledge in this regard.
